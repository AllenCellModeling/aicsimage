The aicsimage library contains two major submodules: io and processing.
The io package is designed to provide an easy interface with CZI, OME-TIFF, and PNG file formats.
The processing package has a number of utility functions to help users generate, crop, and format 2D and 3D images.

To use (with caution), simply do::

    >>> from aicsimage import io, processing
